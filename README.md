## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Working on hobby projects here and there.

Recently been involved in [WESL](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-spec) aka. WGSL Extended, a set of extensions for the WebGPU Shading Language.

Some of my past cool personal projects include 
 * [Teeworlds Web Editor](https://tw.thissma.fr/) an online editor for the video game [Teeworlds](https://ddnet.org/)
 * [MonCraft](https://moncraft.thissma.fr/) a Minecraft clone with browser support
